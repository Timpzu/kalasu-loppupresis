# The Final Presentation

This fun little interactive HTML/JS page served as presentational slides for the final presentation of user-centred design course at the uni for the team I was part of. It is also a homage to a teacher with a unique style of teaching and love for the wheel of fortune.

The page, triggered by clicks, runs through three predetermined topics which after the wheel of fortune gets the will of its own and leaves the earth atmosphere with a heartfelt message. In the end, an animation plays with the wheel travelling through space.
